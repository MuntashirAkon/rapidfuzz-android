# RapidFuzz-Android*

Java JNI implementation of [RapidFuzz-CPP](https://github.com/maxbachmann/rapidfuzz-cpp) library.

**This library is a work in progress. Take a look at the [:app](./app) module to see examples.**

**Disclaimer:** Neither this project nor RapidFuzz-CPP has been audited. Use at your own risk.

\* For Java (not Android) developers: The [`:rapidfuzz`](./rapidfuzz) module can be built without any Android dependency
in any platform. But it isn't supported officially right now. If you are going to use this in your Java project, you
have to modify the [build.gradle](./rapidfuzz/build.gradle) file.
